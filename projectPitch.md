Project Overview
For my project I want to create an IOS app for runners. I run cross country and track for 
LMU so running is a big part of my life. I enjoy listening to music while I run and feel 
that I am able to run better when I do. With this app, I want runners to be able to input 
data about their running such as height, mile time, goal mile time, and other factors to 
calculate what their running cadence is. Then the app will find songs that have a BPM or 
tempo that matches up with that cadence. Then, runners can find a song that matches up with 
their goal pace and use it as a tool to stay on pace and acheive their goal.

Feature Spec
-Input boxes for runner data
-Button that generates songs based on the data
-User profile to save and update data
-Random song button
-Will popssibly link to Spotify so users can go straight to the generated song
-Maybe a message board feature to share songs
